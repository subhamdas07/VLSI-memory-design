# VLSI Memory Design

This project demonstrates a basic memory design using Verilog/SystemVerilog. It includes:

- 📁 `design/` — Memory design code (`design.sv`, etc.)
- 📁 `test/` — Testbench files to simulate and verify the memory design

## 💻 Tools Used
- EDA Playground for simulation  
- SystemVerilog as the HDL

## ✅ Features
- Basic memory block design  
- Functional verification with testbench  
- Clean modular code

## 🚀 How to Run
You can simulate the design using [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/):
1. Open EDA Playground  
2. Paste the contents of `design/design.sv`  
3. Paste the contents of `test/testbench.sv`  
4. Select `SystemVerilog` + your simulator (e.g. Icarus, ModelSim)  
5. Click **Run**
